In reality, it merely upheld the current status quo – a drastic departure from the standard once set by Roe. And an onslaught of challenges, aimed at making abortion impossible, if not illegal, are on the horizon. Joining us to explore this regression we have Melissa Murray, NYU Law Professor and co-host of the Strict Scrutiny Podcast, and Jessica Valenti, founder of AbortionEveryDay.com and author of the forthcoming book, Abortion: Our Bodies, Their Lies, and the Truths We Use to Win. Together, they discuss how our distorted democracy brought us to this moment, unpack the backward slide of abortion rights in America, and offer tips on what we can do to counter this trend. \n\nFollow The Weekly Show with Jon Stewart on social media for more: \n \n> YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@weeklyshowpodcast \n> Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/weeklyshowpodcast\n> TikTok: https://tiktok.com/@weeklyshowpodcast \n> X: https://x.com/weeklyshowpod\n\n\nHost/Executive Producer – Jon Stewart\nExecutive Producer – James Dixon\nExecutive Producer – Chris McShane\nExecutive Producer – Caity Gray\nLead Producer – Lauren Walker\nProducer – Brittany Mehmedovic\nVideo Editor & Engineer – Rob Vitolo\nAudio Editor & Engineer – Nicole Boyce\nResearcher – Catherine Nouhan\nMusic by Hansdale Hsu\n\n—\nThis podcast is brought to you by:\nZipRecruiter\nTry it for free at this exclusive web address: ziprecruiter.com/ZipWeekly\n \n---\nLearn more about your ad choices.

This week, as the Senate marks up next year’s defense spending bill, Jon sits down with Bill Hartung of the Quincy Institute and Roxana Tiron of Bloomberg to investigate whether our arsenal is still bolstering democracy, both abroad and at home. From the active conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza to our rivalry with China, we explore the efficacy of U.S. strategy. Plus, we dive deep into the ballooning defense budget and discuss Jon’s attempts to shine a light on it all. \nAnd you can also check out the tax tool shared with us by a resourceful listener here:\nhttps://us.abalancingact.com/2023-federal-taxpayer-receipt\n\nFollow The Weekly Show with Jon Stewart on social media for more: \n \n> YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@weeklyshowpodcast \n> Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/weeklyshowpodcast\n> TikTok: https://tiktok.com/@weeklyshowpodcast \n> X: https://x.com/weeklyshowpod\n\n\nCREDITS\nHost/Executive Producer – Jon Stewart\nExecutive Producer - James Dixon\nExecutive Producer – Chris McShane\nExecutive Producer – Caity Gray\nLead Producer – Lauren Walker\nProducer – Brittany Mehmedovic\nVideo Editor & Engineer - Rob Vitolo\nAudio Editor& Engineer Nicole Boyce\nResearcher - Catherine Nouhan\nMusic by Hansdle Hsu\n\n—\nThis podcast is brought to you by:\nZipRecruiter\nTry it for free at this exclusive web address: ziprecruiter.com/ZipWeekly\n \nLearn more about your ad choices.
